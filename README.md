Pizza Sales Analysis: SQL Insights Project
A collection of SQL queries designed to extract business insights from pizza sales data, ranging from basic aggregations to advanced analytics.
Short Description / Purpose
This SQL project analyzes a Pizza Sales Dataset to uncover sales performance metrics, customer preferences, and revenue trends through 13 targeted queries. It is intended for data analysts, business managers, and SQL learners to derive actionable insights from transactional data and demonstrate SQL proficiency from basic to advanced levels.
Tech Stack
The project was built using the following tools and technologies:
•  SQL for executing queries and viewing results.
• Presentation – Canva for compliling queries into slides.
• File Format – .sql for query scripts, .pdf for the final project presentation.
Data Source

Source: Public Pizza Sales Dataset (commonly available on platforms like Kaggle).

The dataset comprises relational tables including:
orders: Order IDs, dates, and times.
order_details: Quantities and pizza IDs per order.
pizzas: Pizza IDs, types, sizes, and prices.
pizza_types: Pizza names, categories (e.g., Chicken, Classic), and ingredients.
It captures transactional data for analysis of sales volume, revenue, and trends.

Features / Highlights
Business Problem

Key questions include: What are the top-selling pizzas? When are peak hours? How does revenue accumulate over time?
Goal of the Dashboard
To deliver a set of SQL queries that:

Analyze sales data to answer business questions efficiently.
Support decisions on inventory, marketing, and operations.
Uncover trends in customer behavior, revenue distribution, and product popularity.
